### Description:

#### The Pigment Checker
The _Pigment Checker_ is a reference collection of 17th century paints that have been prepared in the traditional manner of the time. The collection was prepared by students of the _Technical Art History_ Master's programme at the University of Amsterdam to serve as point of reference for researchers in the technical art history field.

The paint squares are applied across 6 traditionally prepared boards with a chalk ground and are grouped by colour. During the application, certain characteristics of the paint, such as colour and handling, were recorded to serve as additional information besides the resulting colour.

#### The website
This website has been developped to allow the information in the Pigment Checker project to be used globally by researchers. It can be used to identify paints by their colour, explore what paints may have looked like when they were applied originally, how paints handle during application, and much more. 

The information is presented hierarchically through the grouping by colour of the different painted boards. Each colour can easily be accessed by selecting the board from the homepage or clicking on the coloured circle in the navbar.

After a colour is selected, the user is presented with all the coloured squares associated with that colour, including some basic information per square (name & manufacturer). Upon clicking a square, a modal presents the user with more detailed information on the selected paint.
