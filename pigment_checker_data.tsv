Our lead white is made with pale linseed oil and basic lead carbonate (made according to modern processes) without stabilizers (e.g. stearates, waxes, etc.) or fillers to alter the characteristics of the pigment. As a result you get higher pigment volume concentration (PVC) than other brands of lead white (flake white)—as high as 50%.

It contains another minor phase (a few percent) which I could not identify.”	"Rublev Colours Stack Flake White is made in small amounts according to sixteenth century Dutch method, differing little to the ""stack"" process of history. It is basic carbonate of lead and usually contains about 70% of lead carbonate and 30% of lead hydroxide. This grade of white lead is composed of the actual flakes that fall off the corroded lead sheets and the white lead that is mechanically removed. It is washed and ground ready for use by the artist. Stack process white lead is ground to about the same granularity typically found in old masters' paintings. This pigment is available as small chunks or pieces that are easily broken and ground in the paint vehicle or in water. We recommend first crushing the pieces in a mortar with a pestle, adding a small amount of vehicle to reduce dust, and then scrape the mixture onto a flat surface to grind further with a muller."

It was also found that it made an acidic solution (~pH 4), meaning that it did not actually create an alkaline solution, ie a lye • The potassium carbonate lye was clear and measured to have a pH around 10 • 100 ml potassium carbonate lye was poured on the azurite (still only the 13.5 g) but no green layer appeared as the recipe speaks off (the other part of 13.5 g was saved / not used further) • The pigment looks more saturated when wet from the lye • The solution was decanted after a few minutes and the decanted solution was set aside8 ...[omitted instructions for first 5 decantations] • For the 6th decantation, still quite a lot of yellowish colour tinges, the deepest blue was at the bottom of the vessel. This means that it probably should be left longer before decanting RECOMMENDATION: take more time (few days) to do the whole recipe properly • We spread out some of the azurite on a watch glass on top of a beaker filled with water (a sort of alternative au-bain-marie) and was heated on a hot plate to speed-dry the pigment "	Homemade pigment from the mayerne manuscript.

4A1	Weld (pot. carbonate/ pot. alum) 	Made in TAH course with Maarten van Bommel (2018)	-	made during TAH Maarten course		"Standard weld lake recipe, recipe 1 (Code: WL-Std):  Put 5 g weld broken into small pieces in a polyester netting bag. Put the bag in a 500 ml beaker and add 300 ml distilled water, soak it overnight (now for 1 hour). Then bring the solution to the boil, with stirring, and boil for 30 minutes. Remove the bag. (If necessary, filter the solution using a glass funnel and folded filters (597½ Whatman)). Add 5 g potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and heat until 80 °C. The pH will be about 11–12. Dissolve 15 g potash alum (KAl(SO4)2•12H2O) in about 90 ml distilled water (this will need to be heated; cool again to room temperature); this is an excess and it will not all be used. Add the alum solution (pH will be about 3) very gradually to the alkaline dye solution with stirring; this will cause effervescence. Continue to add until there is no further effervescence. Check the pH on a regular basis; stop adding the alum solution when the pH is between 6 and 7. Leave to stand overnight for the precipitate to settle. Next the pigment is filtered (or centrifuged) and wash with demineralized water until no colour comes off. To be sure, one can check for access sulphate with the use of a barium chloride solution as this will precipitate. Finally filter to remove all liquid and allow drying. As alternative to filtration one can centrifuge the pigment. Decant some of the supernatant liquid and centrifuge; add distilled water and stir to wash; centrifuge again; repeat several times until no colour comes off, check with barium chloride. Finally filter remaining liquid and dry precipitate in desiccators."

4A3	Weld lake with chalk and alum	Recipe derived from 15th-century Italian recipes for arzica		Annelies van Loon	Made by Annelies van Loon in ±2009 at Maarten van Bommel workshop	"RECIPE 2 – WITH CHALK AND ALUM Recipe derived from 15th-century Italian recipes for arzica: A.P. Torresi, Tecnica artistica a Siena: Alcuni trattati e ricettari del Rinascimento nella Biblioteca degli Intronati, Ferrara 1993: Codex L.XI.41 (Siena, Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati), no. XX, p. 46. Compare M.P. Merrifield, Original Treatises dating from the XIIth to XVIIIth Centuries on the Arts of Painting, 2 vols., London 1849, vol. II: Segreti per colori (the Bolognese Manuscript), no. 194, pp. 482–5. 3 l distilled water was added to c. 100 g dried weld, broken into small pieces, in a 5 l beaker and the mixture was brought to the boil with stirring. It was left to boil until the volume had reduced to c. 2 l in volume and a deeply coloured solution was produced. Excess plant matter was removed by filtering as above to give c. 1 l of a fairly clear golden-brown solution. Then, while warming gently, a mixture of 8 g potash alum (KAl(SO4)2·12H2O) and 32 g chalk (CaCO3), both finely ground, was added to the solution with constant stirring (the two solids were mixed together before addition as implied by the recipe, but they can be added separately, the alum followed by the chalk). The solution started to foam and a bright yellow precipitate was formed. The pH of the supernatant solution was ~ 6–7. The mixture was then covered, cooled and left to react and settle overnight. The next day the precipitate was lemon yellow; the supernatant liquid was yellow and cloudy, with quite a lot of material still in suspension. The precipitate was of a very fine particle size and a number of filter paper grades were tried before eventually settling on a 12.5 cm Grade 3 Whatman filter paper. It was important to try to get rid of the liquor quickly before it started to ferment, but the precipitate was not allowed to go to dryness. The product was washed thoroughly with distilled water until the filtrate was completely colourless; several aliquots of hot water were used towards the end of the process, which took several days. The precipitate was then taken to dryness and transferred to a desiccator. It was stored over silica gel until thoroughly dried. The resulting pale yellow lake was ground using a mortar and pestle.

4C4	Avignon berries precipitated on chalk	Made during Mayerne course				[from logbook Marélise Pollard] • Add the dried Avignon (10g) berries to 200 ml demineralized water and let it soak for a night • Boil for 30 minutes  • Let the Champagne chalk (14.98g) dissolve in demineralized water • Sieve the Avig. Berr. into a clean beaker through a linen cloth. • Heat the solution up to 50°C and add the alum solution (4.990 g alum =alium-aluminiumsulfate) • Heat the solution up to 80°C. Then slowly add the champagne chalk and stir gently until the solution is neutral (measure with pH paper) • Convert the mixture to a cylinder glass and let settle • Decant the cylinder 3 times and let it dry on a petri dish • Scrape the pigment off and put it in a jar	"Mayerne recipe, Location on pigment checker board 4C4"	"Very pale pigment powder, quite fine"	19	0.7	"Greenish yellow, not very tanslucent"	3	3	3	Smoother than the weld	5	3	2	3	1	1	"Seems rather 'warm' on the glass plate, but not on the panel. texture is rather sticky."	1	4	1	3	the texture gets a lot thicker	lead white does not do much for the opacity			Dry				N

4C6	Weld (alum/CaCO3)	Made in TAH course with Maarten van Bommel (2018)				"Weld lake recipe 2 (Code: WL-Al-Ch): Put 5 g weld broken into small pieces in a polyester netting bag large enough to allow the plant material to move freely. Put the bag in a 500 ml beaker and add 300 ml demineralized water, soak it overnight (for now 1 hour). Then bring the solution to the boil, with stirring, and boil for 30 minutes (fig. 6). Remove the bag and filter the solution hot using a glass funnel and folded filters. Add 5 g potash alum (KAl(SO4)2.12H2O) and heat to 80 °C. Weigh out about 15 g calcium carbonate (CaCO3).* Add this very gradually to the alum-dye solution with stirring; this will cause effervescence (foaming) at first, but observe what happens if you add chalk past this point. Leave to stand overnight for the precipitate to settle (fig. 7). Next the pigment is filtered and washed with demineralized water until the filtrate is clear and no further colour comes off. Allow the precipitate to dry in a desiccator. *The more chalk you add, the lighter the colour will be so you may not wish to add the full amount."	made by Marélise and Suzanne during Natural dyes and pigments class. 4C6	"very fine, bright powder"	20	0.6	"very translucent , brownish-yellow"	2	2	3	very brown colour but smeared out--> bright yellow	5	4	4	3	1	2		3	4	1	2	"paints get thicker, more easy to handle"	"more hiding power, less difference in thin and thick applicance"			"Wet, can be scraped with nail"				N
